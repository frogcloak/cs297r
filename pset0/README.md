## Project Title: Simple TODO webapp with only HTML, CSS and Javascript

Author: Diana Feng

The tutorial was originally created by Ayo Isaiah on https://freshman.tech/todo-list/

---
### How to open
To run the webpage, double click on index.html and launch the page in any web browser (Chrome recommended) on a computer.
If the app does not work, please first make sure that index.html is in the same folder as the css and js folders included in the original zip file.

---
### Limitations
The webapp is run entirely in the browser (i.e., no data files created outside of the browser environment). As such, refreshing the page or closing the tab will cause all progress to be lost with no way to recover the content.

---
### Functionality
* Add todo items to todo list
* Check added todo items as done or not done
* Highlight important todo items with a star
* Remove todo items from todo list

---
### How to use
Create your todo items by typing into the text box and pressing enter. Once a todo list has been generated, click on the circle to check off an item. Clicking on the circle again will un-check the item as done. Click on an exmpty star to highlight an important item, and click again to unmark it. Click on the red cross to remove an item from the todo list.

---
### Known issues
The webapp currently does not check the validity of the user input. If the user inputs a very long todo item, the list will not show up properly on the webpage.
